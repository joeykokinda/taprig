## 2026-10-29 — Moto G Play 2024 on Brach

Environment:

- host: Brach, Ubuntu 24.04, Linux 6.8;
- transport: USB ADB, Google platform-tools 37.0.1;
- device: Motorola Moto G Play 2024 (`fogona`), Android 14 / API 34;
- display: 720 x 1600;
- TapRig commits: `d5c9fc6` through `c3e8374`.

Verified results:

1. Linux enumerated the phone over USB.
2. `taprig doctor` classified the authorized ADB transport as passing.
3. `taprig devices` returned the correct serial and model.
4. `taprig execute <serial> key home` sent a typed raw action; Android reported
   Motorola Launcher as `topResumedActivity` afterward.
5. The authenticated local runtime reported the device `ready`, boot complete,
   unlocked, with correct manufacturer/model/product/Android/API identity.
6. Screen-off plus wake produced keyguard `showing=true`.
7. TapRig retrieved a one-time device/purpose-scoped PIN from the in-memory
   credential broker, unlocked locally, and verified fresh keyguard fields
   `showing=false` and `mIsShowing=false`.
8. Credential audit output contained metadata only and did not contain the PIN.

Still unverified on this device:

- semantic Android driver and accessibility actions;
- scrcpy video/manual takeover;
- reliable text entry beyond numeric PIN;
- app launch, taps, and swipes through task-level postcondition verification;
- reconnect across host/device reboot;
- multiple simultaneous devices.
